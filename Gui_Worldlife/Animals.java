    /*The method (findTarget) below is very crucial, the Animal looks for a target to eat within 3 distances.
      It first searches for the closest target, then then closest and so on.
      If a target is found it moves towards that target with the helper function moveTowards.
      Upon moving towards that target on it's way, it may encounter a much closer target.
      If a much closer target is found, it updates its target and sets path for this new target.
      If it doesn't encounter any new targets on its movement, it continues towards the direction
      of the original target. If the original target dies while the Animal is on the prowl to kill it,
      the Animal looks for a another target. All of this is done while the Animal is still active (alive)
